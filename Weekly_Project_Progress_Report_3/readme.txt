My Work : I have designed a dashboard webpage when Admin page when the result of Log In will successful then user come up with dashboard and also created a AdminDepartmentlist page with different functionalities. In that page Admin can add, view and delete any person(user) from any department.In the Backend side I created a security authentication layer so that when any user login first its check and comapre username and password with data from MySQL database.If User is valid than user navigate to userdashboard page otherwise user redirect to login page.For this I used spring.
