My Work : I have established session for Admin and Department model. So, when any admin and department log in to portal, the session will be started and terminated when logout. So far, I used username and password, but now I have changed that functionality and now using email and password to login into system. Moreover, I created APIs to view, edit and delete Department entity. I also designed the Complaint entity as well and it is successfully being created by users. Shaili has designed the JSP files for User, Admin and Department. However, I have modified some content of the jsp files to pass the data from Spring controller so we can derive dynamic data from the database.

For week_5, mainly, I have created the JSP Pages for the Admin and Department portal. For these 2 modules, I have created JSP Pages that includes Header and Footer which contains Header, Nav bar and footer section. I also made individual pages for the different functionalities that includes header and footer. Along with that, I have done required changes in UI of Admin and Department module.
