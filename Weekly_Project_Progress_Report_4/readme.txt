My Work : I have implemented session functionality in Spring MVC for the user module so when any user login to portal, session will be started and when user logout session will be terminated. Moreover, I created a code for sign up page if any user does not have an account, then the user can sign up with his/her information and data will be stored in database. In addition, the user dashboard is linked with all three complaint pages. So, I have covered all the modules of the user.
shaili's work: She has developed a department module User Interface. In that She has designed Dashboard webpage, ComplaintList webpage, ResolveComplaint webpage and ResloveComplaintList webpage for department module.
